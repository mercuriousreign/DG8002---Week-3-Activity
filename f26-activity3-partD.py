# SCENARIO
# Calculate SIMPLE interest on an investment. This exercise does not use
# compound interest, powers, or square roots.
# Formula: interest = principal * rate * time
# Start with:
# Principal (starting investment): $1,000.00
# Annual interest rate: 5% (store this as 0.05)
# Time: 3 years

# TODO 1: Create variables for the principal, annual interest rate, and time.
# principal  = 1000.00
# rate = 0.05
# principal  = input("Type in the principal")
principal = 1000
rate = 0.05
time = 3
# time = int(input("Type in the time: "))

# TODO 2: Calculate the interest earned using the formula above.
interest = principal * rate * time

# TODO 3: Calculate the final investment value (principal + interest).
result = principal + interest

# TODO 4: Print the starting investment, interest earned, and final value.
# Optional: Format money to two decimal places.
print ("Interest earned: ${:,.2f}".format(interest))
print("The final simple interest of the investment is: ${:,.2f}".format(result))

# CHECK YOUR WORK
# Interest earned: $150.00
# Final value: $1,150.00
